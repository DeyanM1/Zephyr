# Built-in Functions

Zephyr comes with several built-in functions that can be used without prior definition.

**Example:**

```zephyr
__ ? JUMP:<Line>;
__ ? WAIT:<Seconds>;
```
- **`JUMP`**: Jumps to a specific function, not a line.
- **`WAIT`**: Wait for a specific amount of second. | INT Variable name support if in `' '`
- **`DUMPING VARIABLES`**: see below
